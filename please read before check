# Provided makefile because my code uses function like ceil(), floor()
# hence require -lm while compiling
# The compilation using makefile requires presence of main.c in the directory
# The commands for compile and execute are as follows
    1.	make 			// this will compile the code and produce "a" as executable file
    2.	./a			//this will run the code
    3.	make clean		//will clean .o files in directory

#Remove directory will remove all the subdirectories and files that the given directory contains
